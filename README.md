# Flappy-Junco
A 2-d longitudinal flight sim for developing motion planning approaches.  The interface is modeled after Gymnasium however, only classical autonomy approaches are used in this project.



1. Test the common case of everything you can. This will tell you when that code breaks after you make some change (which is, in my opinion, the single greatest benefit of automated unit testing).
2. Test the edge cases of a few unusually complex code that you think will probably have errors.
3. Whenever you find a bug, write a test case to cover it before fixing it
4. Add edge-case tests to less critical code whenever someone has time to kill.
